# HR Analytics: Employee Attrition Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Predict whether an employee will leave the company based on historical HR data, and identify key factors contributing to attrition.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- SMOTE for class imbalance handling
- Logistic Regression model
- Power BI for dashboard visualization

## 📊 Dataset
**IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset**  
- 1470 employee records  
- Features include: Age, Department, Job Role, Income, OverTime, etc.  
- Target variable: `Attrition` (Yes/No)

## 🔍 Process
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing & Encoding
3. SMOTE to balance class distribution
4. Logistic Regression model training
5. Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
6. Feature Importance: Coefficients, SHAP (optional)
7. Power BI-ready CSV

## 📁 Outputs
- `attrition_predictions.csv`: Actual vs. predicted attrition
- SHAP bar plot (optional)
- Power BI dashboard plan
- Final report with suggestions

## ✅ Key Insights
- OverTime, Age, and Monthly Income are strong attrition indicators
- SMOTE improves recall on minority class (Attrition = Yes)
